play 爱你没错 by 雷小宝 and run the brute force script in scanning.ipynb to get current and length offsets
in cheat engine, scan for string of the song id in all memory space, find the memory address that holds the string, eliminate until one left, then use pointer scan for this address and find any offset of cloudmusic.dll with offsets 0 1 2 3 of some number and rest to be empty. Fill the offsets in notebook and scan to confirm the address (should agree with what cheat engine shows).
In cheat engine pointer scan page, need to switch around songs and pick the pointer that constantly points to the song id. Most pointers+offsets does not stay.
